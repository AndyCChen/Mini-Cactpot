# MINI CACTPOT
Remade the mini cactpot game from FF14 for the web browser in react.js!  
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
Game here! -> https://mini-cactpot.netlify.app/ <br><br>

## Things I learned ...

- first project with react.js, learned to organized code into re-usable components
- most challenging part was state management, lots of lifting the state up in this project as one component will often
  affect another component so the state need to be passed to several
- second project with javascript so I'm getting more comforable with the syntax
- first hand horror and pain of CSS styling
